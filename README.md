Customer Churn Modeling with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Introduction
This repository contains my first implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for customer churn modeling. As a beginner in deep learning, this project marks my first step into the exciting field of neural networks and machine learning.

Overview
Customer churn modeling is a crucial task for businesses to predict and prevent customer attrition. In this project, I've leveraged the power of artificial neural networks to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Customer Churn Dataset" obtained from [source]. It consists of [describe dataset features]. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (1) or not (0) based on various customer attributes.

Implementation
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and inspected the dataset.
Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.
Processed categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Model Building:

Constructed a feedforward neural network using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
Experimented with different network architectures, activation functions, and hyperparameters.
Evaluated the model using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained the neural network on the training data and monitored performance on the validation set.
Evaluated the model's performance on the test set to assess its generalization ability.
Results:

Analyzed the model's performance metrics and interpreted the results.
Visualized key metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision-recall curve, and confusion matrix.
Derived insights and actionable recommendations for reducing customer churn.
